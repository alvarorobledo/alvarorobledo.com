Let me tell you a bit more about me. I was born and raised in Spain, and lived in Canada for a year before landing here in London for university.

I will be graduating in June 2019 with an MEng (Master's) degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering with Management from Imperial College London.

I have undertaken internships in a start-up (Traventia), research (UROP) and technology at an investment bank (Morgan Stanley). I can speak English and Spanish fluently.

As I grew up, I developed an obsession to quantify and compare everything around me. This fascination with data ended up transforming into my two main current interests: statistical models and machine learning.
